## About the book

Organizations everywhere are becoming more open—and more innovative, agile, and engaged as a result. But can we say the same of our educational organizations?

What if we could build classrooms, departments, or entire educational institutions on the same values that power open source communities? What if we let open organization principles—like transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—guide our experiments in transforming education? How might that change the ways educators prepare students for life in an increasingly open world?

In _The Open Organization Guide for Educators_, more than two dozen advocates for open  education explore these important questions. Students, K‒12 teachers, university faculty, campus CIOs, and leaders of educational non-profits unite to explain the power and promise of a more student-centered, participatory, and inclusive approach to 21st century teaching and learning.
