# The Open Organization Guide for Educators

This respository contains files related to _The Open Organization Guide for Educators_ (working title), a volume in the community-produced [_Open Organization_ book series](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/book-series).

## About the book

The way we design, build, and lead our organizations is changing. Unfortunately our methods for educating the people who _inhabit_ those organizations—and for empowering the people committed to training tomorrow's leaders—aren't.

But what if we could build classrooms, departments, or entire educational institutions on the same principles that power the world's most innovative, agile, and engaged open source communities?

This volume of the [_Open Organization_ book series](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/book-series) explores that question.

Three principal sections comprise the book:

1. **Visions,** chapters about the power, potential, and promise open principles hold for reimagining and reinventing modern educational organizations

2. **Case studies,** examples of experimental and innovative initiatives aimed at making educational organizations more open

3. **Activities,** step-by-step practices for introducing and scaling open principles in education
