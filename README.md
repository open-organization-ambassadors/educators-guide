## About the book

Organizations everywhere are becoming more open—and more innovative, agile, and engaged as a result. But can we say the same of our educational organizations?

What if we could build classrooms, departments, or entire educational institutions on the same values that power the open source communities? What if we could infuse [open principles](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition)—like transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—into reimagined educational organizations? How might that change the ways educators prepare students for life in an increasingly open world?

This volume of the [_Open Organization_ book series](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/book-series) explores those questions.

Three principal sections comprise the book:

1. **Visions,** chapters about the power, potential, and promise open principles hold for reimagining and reinventing modern educational organizations

2. **Case studies,** examples of experimental and innovative initiatives aimed at making educational organizations more open

3. **Activities,** step-by-step practices for introducing and scaling open principles in education
